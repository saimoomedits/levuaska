# Aliases cheatsheet

**Maintainer:** [@hqingyi](https://github.com/hqingyi)

With lots of 3rd-party amazing aliases installed, this plugin helps list the shortcuts
that are currently available based on the plugins you have enabled.

To use it, add `aliases` to the plugins array in your zshrc file:

```zsh
plugins=(aliases)
```

Requirements: Python needs to be installed.

## Usage

- `acs`: show all aliases by group.

- `acs <keyword>`: filter aliases by `<keyword>` and highlight.
